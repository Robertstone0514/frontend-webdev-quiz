# TRACK 1 CAPSTONE- Scoreboard info

`This Track 1 Quiz is not just a quiz on knowledge within the material learned. `
When viewing this project, you will notice there is a `scoreboard` provided that keeps track of the player and
score which is documented at the end of the game. All of this is held in local storage which will remain until that
storage is reset on the local browser. When setting a score, the user with the highest score will be placed for a
medal according to the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place positions on the scoreboard.

The scoreboard contains five places in which `the top 5 scores will be shown`. `If for any reason the 6th player were to tie with player number 5, then the existing player number 5 will be removed from the scoreboard, and player number 6 will become the new player number 5`.
